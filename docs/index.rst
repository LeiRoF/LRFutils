Welcome to LRFutils's documentation!
====================================

This lib is a set of tools that I maintain firstly for my, secondly for my colleagues and sometime, when I have time and I don't know what to do, I make it user-friendly and bugless to allow anyone to use it.

I don't guaranty any kind of performance, stability, etc. use it at your own risks ^^
